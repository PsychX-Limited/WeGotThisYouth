# WeGotThisYouth
This is a groundbreaking open-source initiative focused on promoting mental health awareness within high schools. Our primary objective is to develop a generative AI equipped with a real-time response system, designed to assist individuals experiencing mental health crises in finding solace and the necessary support. This innovative system will be integrated into Panic booths, thoughtfully crafted by PsychX, and strategically positioned within high schools.
We are thrilled to announce that the inaugural code release is scheduled for December 1, 2023. If you share our passion for this noble cause, we invite you to reach out and explore ways to be a part of this initiative. Whether you are a developer, investor, potential partner, or a dedicated mental health advocate or professional, your involvement can make a significant impact. Get in touch with us today to join this vital mission.
